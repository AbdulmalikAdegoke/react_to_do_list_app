# react_to_do_list_app
My react to do list app

This app implements the reactjs framework to fulfil the basic requirements of a to do list, that is:
- Adding of a task to the to do list
- Toggling of a task a complete or incomplete
- Editing of a task
- Deleting of individual tasks
- Deleting of complete tasks
- Clearing of the entire list

The front end of the to do list was also refined using the reactstrap framework.
